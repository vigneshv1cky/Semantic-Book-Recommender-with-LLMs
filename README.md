# Semantic Book Recommender 🎓📚

## Overview & Inspiration ✨

Imagine wandering through an endless, magical library—shelves stretching beyond sight, each tome whispering a promise of adventure, wisdom, or simply a cozy read. Our **Semantic Book Recommender** is your enchanted guide, powered by the latest in AI wizardry. Instead of sifting through tags or bestseller lists, you simply describe what you crave—be it a heartwarming tale about nature’s wonders or a spine-chilling mystery—and voilà, the perfect book appears!

Why rely on dusty keywords when you can harness the expressiveness of natural language? We blend cutting-edge embedding models with emotion detection and genre insights to conjure recommendations that resonate with both your mind and mood.

## Features 🚀

* **Natural-Language Queries**: No more checkbox quests! Ask in plain English (or any language you fancy) and watch AI understand your intent. 🗣️➡️🤖
* **Emotion-Aware Ranking**: Feeling joyful, pensive, or spooky? Sort your results by emotion—our system gauges the emotional “vibe” of each description (joy, anger, surprise, and more) so your next read matches your mood. 🎭
* **Genre Intuition**: Even if a book’s metadata is scant, our zero-shot classifier swoops in, inferring whether it’s fiction, nonfiction, children’s literature, and beyond. Think of it as a literary Sherlock Holmes, deducing the hidden identity of every title. 🕵️‍♂️
* **Bespoke Captions & Thumbnails**: Each suggestion comes with a crisp caption—title, snappy snippet, and author names elegantly joined—plus a cover image sized for visual delight. 📷🖼️

## How It Works: Under the Hood 🤓🔍

1. **Data Alchemy & Preprocessing**
   We scour a 7K+ book catalog, filter for entries rich in descriptions, and tag each with its ISBN—ensuring every text fragment is uniquely identifiable.

2. **Embedding Enchantment**
   Sentences become vectors via OpenAI embeddings; these numerical “spell scrolls” allow semantic similarity searches, so “forest adventure” knows kinship with “nature exploration.”

3. **Genre Sleuthing**
   Missing genre labels? No problem. A zero-shot transformer model (think BART-MNLI) steps in, classifying uncategorized books into broad genres, even if they’ve never seen that exact label before.

4. **Emotion Scoring**
   We split each description into sentences, run an emotion classifier (courtesy of a DistilRoBERTa model), and record the maximum intensity per emotion—building an emotional profile for every book.

5. **Semantic Search & Ranking**

   * **Step 1:** Embed your query and retrieve the top-N semantically closest books.
   * **Step 2:** Optionally filter by your chosen genre.
   * **Step 3:** Re-order the shortlist by the specific emotion you want (e.g., “sadness” for tear-inducing narratives).
     Final result: a curated squad of stories perfectly aligned with both content and feeling.

6. **Interactive Gradio Magic**
   A few lines of Gradio code spin up a sleek UI: text input, dropdowns for genre and mood, and a gallery of clickable book covers. It’s like having a personal librarian in your browser!
